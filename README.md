## Hi, I'm Syed Abdul Nayeem

## Data Scientist | Predictive Modeling | Machine Learning | Python | SQL | Azure

I’m a Data Scientist with 2+ years of experience building end-to-end data science and predictive modeling solutions. My work focuses on EDA, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and delivering insights that support real business decisions across e-commerce, finance, and retail domains.

I enjoy working with structured datasets and developing practical machine learning models. I’m also exploring Generative AI and LLM fundamentals to grow in modern AI applications.

 Projects
 ### Shop Sales Forecasting (Time Series)

Forecasted daily sales for a retail coffee chain to optimize inventory and staffing.

Built time-series models using feature engineering (lags, moving averages) and LSTM on Azure.

### Credit Risk Prediction

Developed classification models to predict loan default probability using customer billing and payment data.

Applied EDA, SMOTE for class imbalance, and evaluated models using AUC and accuracy.

### Olist Brazilian Dataset Analysis

Performed e-commerce data analysis to uncover customer behavior, sales trends, and delivery insights.

Used Python and SQL for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

### Insurance Claim Prediction

Built predictive models to estimate insurance claim likelihood and amounts.

Focused on regression, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

### IPL Auction Data Analysis

Analyzed IPL auction data to identify player valuation trends and key bidding factors.

Conducted exploratory data analysis and applied basic ML techniques.

## Currently exploring: Generative AI, LLM basics, and modern ML workflows
## Focus areas: Predictive modeling, business analytics, and applied machine learning
