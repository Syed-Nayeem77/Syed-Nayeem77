Hi, I'm Syed Abdul Nayeem

Senior Data Scientist | Machine Learning | Recommender Systems | Python, SQL, PyTorch | MLOps

I build scalable, fair, and interpretable machine learning solutions with end-to-end pipelines, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model deployment and monitoring. My work focuses on recommender systems, bias mitigation, and real-world business impact.

Featured Projects
Fair Job Recommender System

A bias-aware, two-tower neural recommender for candidate-job matching, including fairness metrics, explainable predictions (SHAP), and MLOps deployment with monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining.

Customer Churn Prediction

An end-to-end ML pipeline demonstrating EDA, feature engineering, model evaluation, explainability, and deployment via APIs and CI/CD pipelines.

Other Projects

Olist Brazilian Dataset Analysis – E-commerce insights and analytics.

Insurance Claim Prediction – Predictive modeling and regression analysis.

IPL Auction Data Analysis – Exploratory data analysis and ML modeling.
